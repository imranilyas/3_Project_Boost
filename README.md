# Unity Project: Rocket Controlled Boost #
This is a simple platform game where the pilot of a rocket must get from Point A to Point B.

The rocket is powered through relative force allowing for rotation and translation.

PS: the levels are not finished. Only 2 levels have been created. The subsequent levels that follow are a copy of Level 2 to test functionality. These will be updated later.
